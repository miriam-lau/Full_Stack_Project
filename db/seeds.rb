Set aside.\n2. In a large Dutch oven or saucepan, bring 2 quarts of water and 2 tablespoons (24g) of salt to a boil over high heat. Add pasta and cook, stirring frequently to prevent sticking, until cooked but still very firm (not quite al dente), about 45 seconds for fresh pasta or 1 minute less than package directions indicate for dried pasta. Drain pasta into a colander set over a large bowl. Transfer 2 cups (480ml) of cooking water to a liquid measuring cup and discard the rest. Transfer pasta to the now-empty bowl. Add garlic and butter and toss to coat.\n3. Whisking constantly, slowly add 1 1/2 cups of pasta cooking water to bowl with cheese mixture. Transfer cheese mixture to the now-empty pasta cooking pot, scraping the bottom to make sure you get everything. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula, until mixture comes to a boil and thickens, about 45 seconds. Season sauce to taste with more salt and pepper as desired. Transfer pasta to sauce mixture and turn to coat. Just before serving, stir in more pasta water to thin sauce out as necessary. Serve immediately, sprinkled with minced herbs, black pepper, and cheese, and drizzled with additional olive oil.",

  rating: 5.0,
  description: "A must comfort-food from Ina Garten",
  directions: "1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.\n2. Place the chicken breasts on a baking sheet and rub them with olive oil. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Roast for 35 to 40 minutes, or until cooked through. Set aside until cool enough to handle, then remove the meat from the bones and discard the skin. Cut the chicken into large dice. You will have 4 to 6 cups of cubed chicken.\n3. In a small saucepan, heat the chicken stock and dissolve the bouillon cubes in the stock. In a large pot or Dutch oven, melt the butter and saute the onions over medium-low heat for 10 to 15 minutes, until translucent. Add the flour and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Add the hot chicken stock to the sauce. Simmer over low heat for 1 more minute, stirring, until thick. Add 2 teaspoons salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and heavy cream. Add the cubed
  chicken, carrots, peas, onions and parsley. Mix well.\n4. For the pastry, mix the flour, salt, and baking powder in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Add the shortening and butter and mix quickly with your fingers until each piece is coated with flour. Pulse until the fat is the size of peas (~10 times). With the motor running, add the ice water; process only enough to moisten the dough and have it just come together. Dump the dough out onto a floured board and knead quickly into a ball. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes.\n5. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.\n6. Divide the filling equally among 4 ovenproof bowls. Divide the dough into quarters and roll each piece into an 8-inch circle. Brush the dough with egg wash and make three slits in the top. Sprinkle with sea salt and cracked pepper. Place on a baking sheet and bake for 1 hour, or until the top is golden brown and the filling is bubbling hot.",

Preheat a large stainless steel saut√© pan or skillet over high heat for 2 minutes. Place balls of beef in pan and smash down with a stiff metal spatula, using a second spatula to add pressure. Smashed patties should be slightly wider than burger bun.\n3. Season generously with salt and pepper and allow to cook until patties are well browned and tops are beginning to turn pale pink/gray in spots, about 45 seconds. Using a bench scraper or the back side of a stiff metal spatula, carefully scrape patties from pan, making sure to get all of the browned bits.\n4. Flip patties and immediately place a slice of cheese over 1 patty, then stack the second directly on top. Immediately remove from pan and transfer to waiting burger bun. Serve.",
  notes: "These burgers cook very fast, so it's best to make them one at a time. If making multiple burgers, keep them warm under a tent of foil while preparing subsequent burgers.",

recipe6 = Recipe.create(name: "Chinese Tea Eggs", serving: 6,
  ingredients: "6 eggs\n3 to 4 tablespoons soy sauce\n1 teaspoon salt\n1 tablespoon black tea leaves\n3 to 4 pieces star anise\n1 small stick cinnamon\n2 to 3 strips dried orange\n1 teaspoon cracked peppercorns\n1 teaspoon sugar (optional)",
  rating: 5.0,
  description: "Street-style tea eggs are a popular snack in China and
  Taiwan. Recipe from Food52.",
  directions: "1. Place eggs in a pot and cover with about an inch of cold water. Bring to a boil, then simmer for 1 to 2 minutes.\n2. Rinse the eggs with cold water. One by one, take each egg and tap it gently with the blunt end of a knife or the back of a spoon until the entire surface is lightly cracked.\n3. If small pieces flake off, don't worry, but do try to keep the shell intact over the egg.\n4. Return the eggs to the pot and refill with water. Add just enough water to barely cover the eggs, but for the sake of precision, it should be about 1 1/2 to 2 cups. Add the rest of the ingredients: soy sauce, salt, tea, star anise, cinnamon, orange peel, pepper, and sugar (optional), and give it a good stir.\n5. Bring the mixture back to a boil, then reduce the heat to low\n6. Simmer for 3 hours in a pot uncovered as it yields firmer eggs with better flavor. The water will evaporate fairly quickly, so add more as it simmers.\n7. These eggs never have the soft, bright yellow yolks you get from hard-boiling for just a few minutes. They often have that greenish tinge because they cook for much longer.\n8. For a stronger flavor, steep overnight after you finish simmering.",

Transfer to a small heat-resistant bowl and cool to about 212¬∞F (100¬∞C).\n2. Dip cold apples in caramel, letting excess drip off before transferring to a parchment-lined cutting board.
