Repeat with remaining 2 batches of wings.\n2. Place baking sheet with wings in refrigerator and allow to rest, uncovered, at least 8 hours and up to 24 hours.\n3. Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and preheat oven to 450¬∞F (230¬∞C). Add chicken wings and cook for 20 minutes. Flip wings and continue to cook until crisp and golden brown, 15 to 30 minutes longer, flipping a few more times towards the end.\n4. Meanwhile, combine butter and hot sauce in a small saucepan and cook over medium heat, whisking until combined. Transfer wings to a large bowl, add sauce, and toss to thoroughly coat. Serve wings immediately with blue cheese dressing and celery sticks, conspicuously shunning anyone who says that real Buffalo wings must be fried.",
  notes: "Air-drying the wings overnight helps them crisp up faster when you bake them, which corresponds to juicier meat in the end.\nBaking powder adds surface area to the chicken wings, intensifying their crunch.",

One by one, take each egg and tap it gently with the blunt end of a knife or the back of a spoon until the entire surface is lightly cracked.\n3. If small pieces flake off, don't worry, but do try to keep the shell intact over the egg.\n4. Return the eggs to the pot and refill with water. Add just enough water to barely cover the eggs, but for the sake of precision, it should be about 1 1/2 to 2 cups. Add the rest of the ingredients: soy sauce, salt, tea, star anise, cinnamon, orange peel, pepper, and sugar (optional), and give it a good stir.\n5. Bring the mixture back to a boil, then reduce the heat to low\n6. Simmer for 3 hours in a pot uncovered as it yields firmer eggs with better flavor. The water will evaporate fairly quickly, so add more as it simmers.\n7. These eggs never have the soft, bright yellow yolks you get from hard-boiling for just a few minutes. They often have that greenish tinge because they cook for much longer.\n8. For a stronger flavor, steep overnight after you finish simmering.",

Set aside.\n2. In a large Dutch oven or saucepan, bring 2 quarts of water and 2 tablespoons (24g) of salt to a boil over high heat. Add pasta and cook, stirring frequently to prevent sticking, until cooked but still very firm (not quite al dente), about 45 seconds for fresh pasta or 1 minute less than package directions indicate for dried pasta. Drain pasta into a colander set over a large bowl. Transfer 2 cups (480ml) of cooking water to a liquid measuring cup and discard the rest. Transfer pasta to the now-empty bowl. Add garlic and butter and toss to coat.\n3. Whisking constantly, slowly add 1 1/2 cups of pasta cooking water to bowl with cheese mixture. Transfer cheese mixture to the now-empty pasta cooking pot, scraping the bottom to make sure you get everything. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula, until mixture comes to a boil and thickens, about 45 seconds. Season sauce to taste with more salt and pepper as desired.

Add 2 teaspoons salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and heavy cream. Add the cubed
  chicken, carrots, peas, onions and parsley. Mix well.\n4. For the pastry, mix the flour, salt, and baking powder in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Add the shortening and butter and mix quickly with your fingers until each piece is coated with flour. Pulse until the fat is the size of peas (~10 times). With the motor running, add the ice water; process only enough to moisten the dough and have it just come together. Dump the dough out onto a floured board and knead quickly into a ball. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes.\n5. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.\n6. Divide the filling equally among 4 ovenproof bowls. Divide the dough into quarters and roll each piece into an 8-inch circle. Brush the dough with egg wash and make three slits in the top. Sprinkle with sea salt and cracked pepper.

  directions: "1. For the Dough: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350¬∞F (177¬∞C). Combine pecans and powdered sugar in a 10-inch stainless steel skillet and toast in oven until fragrant but not deeply browned, 12 to 15 minutes. When pecans and sugar have cooled to room temperature, combine with flour, cold butter, vanilla, salt, and cinnamon in the bowl of a food processor. (Save the skillet for step 2.) Pulse until pecan pieces disappear, then continue pulsing to form a stiff dough.\n2. To Finish: Sprinkle about half of powdered sugar into skillet, then divide dough into 20 half-ounce portions (I use a #60 scoop). Tumble each piece in powdered sugar until fully coated and roll into a ball. When all pieces have been rounded up, shake skillet so the cookie dough rolls around, collecting more sugar. Arrange on a parchment-lined half sheet pan and bake until puffed and firm, about 18 minutes. Cool to room temperature directly on baking sheet and sift remaining powdered sugar on top.",
  notes: "Toasting gives the pecans and the powdered sugar more depth of flavor.\nA food processor does the work of chopping the pecans and mixing the dough all at once.\nSmaller portions of dough have a better ratio of cookie to powdered sugar, so portion these out with a scoop or scale.",
